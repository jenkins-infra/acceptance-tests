= Verify content of the update site

https://updates.jenkins.io provides version-specific update sites so that the update site can offer plugin releases compatible with your version of Jenkins.
The `?version=` query parameter is used to request a version specific update site.

The current implementation of the site uses redirect rules to forward requests to the most appropriate tiered update site.
More details are available in the description of link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/site/LAYOUT.md#regular-tiered-update-sites-lts-and-weekly["regular tiered update sites (LTS and weekly)].
